      "value": "If your C-Ratio is below the Target Collateralization Ratio (currently set at 750% Collateral), Mintr will display your status as 'Poor' and you will need to increase your C-Ratio to earn maximum fees.\n\nYou can increase your C-Ratio in two ways:\n\n1. Burning sUSD\n2. Buying more SNX and mint more sUSD.\nIf your C-Ratio is below the Target Collateralization Ratio, you will be blocked and unable to claim your fee rewards. \n\nIf your C-Ratio is above the Target Collateralization Ratio, Mintr will display your status as 'Good' and you can then:\n\n1. Do nothing. Continue to receive fees against your existing minted sUSD\n2. Mint more sUSD. To receive a greater proposition of fees in the next fee period.\nIf you choose to mint more sUSD, you may want to leave a buffer of sUSD to accommodate market fluctuation of the SNX price.\n\nYour Collateralization Ratio must be above the Target Collateralization Ratio to be able to claim your fee rewards.
