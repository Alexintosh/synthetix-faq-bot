      "value": "There are several reasons why they might not be showing up. The most common reason is that you were affected by the proxy contract cutover on May 10. This can look like this. If you want them to show up on that platform, you'll need to 'emit an event' with your SNX by interacting them in some way. The simplest way is by sending yourself (i.e. to your own wallet) a transfer for 0 SNX. using this token address: 0xC011a73ee8576Fb46F5E1c5751cA3B9Fe0af2a6F. Please note you'll need some ETH in your wallet to pay for gas.\n\nOne other reason is that your SNX is still escrowed from the Havven token sale â€” they can be vested through Mintr in the ESCROW tab by clicking on the 'View Token Sale Escrow' button."
